# Infrastructure Setup

First you have to create requried Azure resources for your team. To make things easy we created a **deploy-team.sh** script for you. Find below instructions how you run it.
Besides the infra used for the hackathon ((AKS clusters, AppInsights, KeyVaults etc) the script also creates a storage account for TF state, found in RG state<teamname><location>.
  
> Hint: The resources created may be edited by the hackteams according to requirements throughout the day. 

## Here's what you do (READ CAREFULLY)

1. Open CloudShell on http://shell.azure.com, if required create a storage account (only for cloud shell sessions) in your subscription and open Bash. (You could also do all of this on your machine but CloudShell is pretty handy.)

2. Clone this repo in CloudShell. This command downloads the git repository to your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USER/ORG_NAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>.git
```

3. You'll find resource definitions as code (infrastructure as code) in a bunch of *.tf files in the **terrafrom** folder. Deploy them using the following command but replace <team_name> with your actual team's name, <region> with your preferred region and <subscription_id> with your subscription id.
Make the file executable first. Make sure you run this in the right directory.
```
chmod +x ./deploy-team.sh
```

Pick a name for your team. The name will be reflected in your Azure resources. Avoid special characters and keep it short (7char max).
``` 
./deploy-team.sh <team_name> northeurope <subscription_id>
```

After the script has been executed you will see two resource groups, one holding TF storage, the other one holding e.g. the AKS cluster etc.

**Note: Please see the Terraform output, it includes the SQL Server password and the SQL connection string**


## Gameengine Setup

1. An instance of Azure SQL and a SQL DB should have been deployed to your RG
2. Adjust the firewall in the Azure Portal for Azure SQL Server so you can work with the DB
3. Also allow other Azure Services to access SQL Server so your cluster can talk to the DB
4. In the Azure Portal open your SQL Database,  go to the Query editor and execute the scripts in the [https://github.com/azure-adventure-day/aad-team/tree/master/DatabaseScripts] folder
5. Take a note of the SQL database connection string
6. Switch to the GameEngine folder and modify the `blackbox_gameengine_deployment.yaml` file to reference your connection strings. Make sure you set the password correctly in the DB connection string. You can do this directly in the CloudShell using VIM in the right folder. (vim blackbox_gameengine_deployment.yaml) Or you can choose the fancy way and run ***code .*** to get a more graphical user experience of an editor within CloudShell. (this will open a Visual Studio Code like experience in the browser.)

7. You can deploy directly from Cloud Shell. Run the following command to be able to use kubectl with your aks cluster.
```
az aks get-credentials -n <aks_cluster_name> -g <resource_group_name>
```
8. Deploy the game engine using kubectl. 
```
kubectl apply -f blackbox_gameengine_deployment.yaml
```
9. Figure out the public endpoint which can be used to call your game engine. Use the command below and get the public IP of the gameengine service. 
```
kubectl get services --field-selector metadata.name=blackboxgameengine --output=jsonpath={.items..status.loadBalancer.ingress..ip}
```
10. If you found your endpoint, you can call it on `http://<YOUR_ENDPOINT_IP>/Match` in the browser.

11. Important: **You have to provide this URL in the team portal**, so gambling can start. **But make sure you deploy your gamebot first (see instructions below) otherwise the engine will fail and you will get malus points.**


## Gamebot Setup
You can deploy directly from ghcr.io/azure-adventure-day/azure-adventure-day-coach/gamebot:latest without an additional build. 



### Deployment

1. Deploy your bot.
```
kubectl apply -f gamebot_deployment.yaml
```

2. Test your Bot
You can get the IP of your bot by running 
```
kubectl get services --field-selector metadata.name=arcadebackend --output=jsonpath={.items..status.loadBalancer.ingress..ip}
```

You can test your bot by posting a request to your bot's public IP http://A.B.C.D/pick. The result should look like this: ***{"Move":"snap","Bet":null}***. Here's a sample request for the commandline.

```
GAME_BOT_IP=$(kubectl get services --field-selector metadata.name=arcadebackend --output=jsonpath={.items..status.loadBalancer.ingress..ip})
curl --location --request POST "http://$GAME_BOT_IP/pick" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"Player1Name":"daniel","MatchId":"42"}'
```

You can test your engine by posting a request to your engine's public IP. The result contains all the info for the current match. Here's a sample request.
```
GAME_ENGINE_IP=$(kubectl get services --field-selector metadata.name=blackboxgameengine --output=jsonpath={.items..status.loadBalancer.ingress..ip})
curl --location --request POST "http://$GAME_ENGINE_IP/Match" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"ChallengerId":"daniel","Move": "Rock"}'
```
For subsequent requests, make sure you put the gameid from the response into the request.

## Register your game endpoint

**Register your game endpoint in your team portal. As soon as you have registered it customers will start gambling and your performance is being measured. So make sure everything works as expected up front!**


### Optional: Build and push bot image manually
If you change the source code you can build and push the container manually or use a prepared github action (check the .github/workflows folder). 
To modify, build and push the bot before deploying it, follow these steps:

1. Build the image you want to use, eg like this.
```

// or use Azure Container Registry (was already deployed above)
az acr build --image gamebot:latest --registry myveryownregistry --file Dockerfile .
```

2. Ensure your AKS has access to the Container Registry. If using your own Azure Container Registry a pull-secret needs to be configured
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry teamregistry --docker-server 'myveryownregistry.azurecr.io' --docker-username 'username' --docker-password 'password' --docker-email 'example@example.com'
```

3. Ensure that gamebot_deployment.yaml uses this pull-secret

4. Change the file gamebot_deployment.yaml to reference your bot image
